# WindowFinder by Marcus Jensen / tsgsOFFICIAL 07/08/2023
WindowFinder, as the name suggests, is a console application (Framework 4.8), which purpose is to find a specific window.
It returns the screen of which that window is present on (if any).

Useful if you're using OCR on a specific application, but the users might move that application/window around on their monitors.
